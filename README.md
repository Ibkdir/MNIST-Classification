## Highlights
- **He Initialization & SGD:** Employs He initialization and Stochastic Gradient Descent for effective training.
- **Built with Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib:** Relies solely on these Python libraries for all computational, data handling, and visualization needs.

## Performance
Achieves ~91% accuracy on both training and test datasets in under 200 training iterations.
